## How to play?
<pre>
___________________________________________________________________
| Aim is to guide the snakeüêç to eat apples(here red circles).    |
| Each apple eaten gets you a score of +1.                        | 
| Hitting wall or body leads to GameOver.                         |
| Speed increases exponentially when snake eats every 5th apple.  |
| Score will be displayed on top and GameOver screen.             | 
| Press space bar to restart the game after GameOver.             |
| Happy Playing!‚úåÔ∏è                                                 |
